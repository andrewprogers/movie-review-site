feature "User Signs Out" do
  # As an authenticated user
  # I want to be able to sign out
  # So that no one else can post a movie or review on my behalf
  #
  # Acceptance Criteria:
  # If a user is signed in, they should see
  # a link to sign out on the banner of the page
  # Clicking on the link should sign the user out of the site immediately
  # Once signed out, their username should not be displayed anymore
  # If the user is not signed in, they wonâ€™t see the link to sign out
